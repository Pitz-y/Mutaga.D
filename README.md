## Personal Portfolio

A simple, responsive personal portfolio website with a navbar, social links, about, skills, projects, and contact sections.

### Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view locally.
2. Edit the placeholders:
   - Replace `Your Name`, `you@example.com`, and social links.
   - Add your own projects and links.
   - Put a profile image at `assets/profile.jpg` (optional).

### Structure
- `index.html` — Semantic HTML for all sections

- `assets/` — Images and media (you can create this folder)

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

git commit -m "Initial portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`.
   - Branch: `main` and folder `/root`.
